# [Neural Networks & Deep Learning Course](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/master/1.%20Neural%20Networks%20%26%20Deep%20Learning%20Course)

Learned the foundations of deep learning, its architectures, how to implement it, and the major technology trends driving it through the following projects:

## [Logistic Regression with a Neural Network](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/1.%20Neural%20Networks%20%26%20Deep%20Learning%20Course/Week%202/Logistic%20Regression%20as%20a%20Neural%20Network/Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset_v6a.ipynb)
The first programminng assigment were I learned how to build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
- Initializing parameters
- Calculating the cost function and its gradient
- Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

## [Planar Data_Classification with One Hidden Layer](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/1.%20Neural%20Networks%20%26%20Deep%20Learning%20Course/Week%203/Planar%20data%20classification%20with%20one%20hidden%20layer/Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer_v6c.ipynb)
Built my first neural network with one hidden layer and learned how to:
- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
- Compute the cross entropy loss
- Implement forward and backward propagation

## [Building a Deep Neural Network Step by Step](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/1.%20Neural%20Networks%20%26%20Deep%20Learning%20Course/Week%204/Building%20your%20Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Step%20by%20Step/Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step_v8a.ipynb)
Built the functions for the implementation of a deep neural network with several hidden layers from scratch. 

## [Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/1.%20Neural%20Networks%20%26%20Deep%20Learning%20Course/Week%204/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20Application:%20Image%20Classification/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Application%20v8.ipynb)
Built a deep neural network for solving an image classification problem by using the functions that were created in the previous project.
