# [Convolutional Neural Networks Course](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/master/3.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20Course)
The course focused on:
- Understanding how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks. 
- How to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
- Using neural style transfer to generate art. 
- Apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data. 

## [Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/3.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20Course/week1/Convolution_model_Step_by_Step_v2a.ipynb)
Built and implemented convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation.

## [Emotion Detection in Images of Faces with Keras](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/3.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20Course/week2/KerasTutorial/Keras_Tutorial_v2a.ipynb)
Learned to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK. As a final goal, created an app that classified emotions based on images.

## [Residual Networks](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/3.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20Course/week2/ResNets/Residual_Networks_v2a.ipynb)
Built the basic building blocks of ResNets (identity and convolutional blocks) and put them together to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.

## [Autonomous driving - Car detection](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/3.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20Course/week3/Car%20detection%20for%20Autonomous%20Driving/Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection_v3a.ipynb)
Learned to use object detection on a car detection data set and dealing with bounding boxes. The project focused on the YOLO model and the ideas decribe inthe two YOLO papers: Redmon et al., 2016 and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016.

## [Face Recognition](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/3.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20Course/week4/Face%20Recognition/Face_Recognition_v3a.ipynb)
Built a face recognition system using many of the ideas coming from FaceNet (A neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person). These while:
- Implementing the triplet loss function
- Useing a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings
- Using these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition

### [Art Generation Style Transfer](https://github.com/Omar-Martinez/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/3.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20Course/week4/Neural%20Style%20Transfer/Art_Generation_with_Neural_Style_Transfer_v3a.ipynb)
Implemented the neural style transfer algorithm presented in Gatys et al. (2015) and generate novel artistic images .
